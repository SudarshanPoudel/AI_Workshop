This field is very much associated with mathematics and \\ncomputer science with application in many fields like computer security, electronic commerce, \\ntelecommunication, etc. \\n \\nSo cryptography is a subject that should be of interest to many people, especially because we \\nnow live in the Information Age, and our secrets can be transmitted in so many ways – email, \\ncell phone, etc. – and all these channels need to be protected [ simon singh]. \\n \\nSecrecy and Encryption \\n \\nIn the ancient days, cryptography was mostly referred to as encryption – the mechanism to \\nconvert the readable plaintext into unreadable (incomprehensible) text i.e. ciphertext, and \\ndecryption – the opposite process of encryption i.e. conversion of ciphertext back to the \\nplaintext.  Though the consideration of cryptography was on message confidentiality \\n(encryption) in the past, nowadays cryptography considers the study and practices of \\nauthentication, digital signatures, integrity checking, and key management, etc. \\n \\nEncryption mostly provides the secrecy of massage being transmitted over the communication \\nnetwork. This is called confidentiality of massage. The only sender knows the keys and can \\ndecipher the massage. \\n \\nCryptology \\n \\nCryptanalysis is the breaking of codes. Cryptanalysis encompasses all of the techniques to \\nrecover the plaintext and/or key from the ciphertext. \\n \\nThe combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis is known as cryptology. Though most of \\nthe time we use cryptography and cryptology in the same way.  \\n \\nObjective of cryptography \\n \\n \\nEncryption and Decryption \\n \\nEncryption is the process of encoding a message so that its meaning is not obvious i.e. \\nconverting information from one form to some other unreadable form using some algorithm \\ncalled cipher with the help of secret message called key. The converting text is called is plaintext \\nand the converted text is called ciphertext.  \\n \\ncsitnepal\\nDownloaded from CSIT Tutor'),\n",

In decryption process also the use of key is important. \\n \\nAlternatively, the terms encode and decode or encipher and decipher are used instead of encrypt \\nand decrypt. That is, we say that we encode, encrypt, or encipher the original message to hide its \\nmeaning. Then, we decode, decrypt, or decipher it to reveal the original message. \\n \\n \\n \\nPlaintext \\nCiphertext \\nOriginal Plaintext \\n \\n \\nFig: Encryption-Decryption \\n \\nThe use of encryption techniques is being used since very long period as it can be noted from the \\ntechnique called Caesar’s cipher used by Julius Caesar for information passing to his soldiers. \\nEncryption techniques have also been extensively used in military purposes to conceal the \\ninformation from the enemy. Nowadays to gain the confidentiality encryption is being used in \\nmany areas like communication, internet banking, digital right management, etc. \\n \\nKey \\n \\nA key is a parameter or a piece of information used to determine the output of cryptographic \\nalgorithm. While doing the encryption, key determines the transformation of plaintext to the \\ncipher text and vice versa. Keys are also used in other cryptographic processes like message \\nauthentication codes and digital signatures. Most of the cryptographic systems depend upon the \\nkey and thus the secrecy of the key is very important and is one of the difficult problems in \\npractice. Another important issue for the key is its length. Since key is the sole entity that defines \\nthe strength of the security (normally algorithm used is public) we need to select the key in a way \\nsuch that attacker should take long enough to try all possibilities. To prevent the key from being \\nguessed the choice of the key must be random. \\n \\nCipher \\n \\nDecryption \\nEncryption \\ncsitnepal\\nDownloaded from CSIT Tutor'),\n",

The operation of cipher \\ndepends upon the special information called key. Without knowledge of the key, it should be \\ndifficult, if not nearly impossible, to decrypt the resulting cipher into readable plaintext. There \\nare many types of encryption techniques that have advanced from history, however the \\ndistinction of encryption technique can be broadly categorized in terms of number of key used \\nand way of converting plaintext to the ciphertext. \\n \\nCryptosystem  \\n \\nCryptosystem is a 5-tuple/quintuple (E, D, M, K, C), where M set of plaintexts, K set of keys, C \\nset of ciphertexts, E set of encryption functions e: M \\uf0b4 K \\uf0ae C and D set of decryption functions \\nd: C \\uf0b4 K \\uf0ae M.  \\n \\nExample: Caesar Cipher \\nM = {sequences of letters} \\nK = {i | i is an integer and 0 ≤ i ≤ 25} \\nE = {Ek | k \\uf0ce K and for all letters m, Ek(m) = (m + k) mod 26 } \\nD = {Dk | k \\uf0ce K and for all letters c, Dk(c) = (26 + c – k) mod 26} \\nC = M \\n \\nCryptographic system characteristics \\n \\nCryptographic systems are characterized along three independent dimensions: \\n \\nThe type of operations used for transforming plaintext to ciphertext. All encryption \\nalgorithms are based on two general principles: substitution, in which each element in the \\nplaintext (bit, letter, group of bits or letters) is mapped into another element, and transposition, in \\nwhich elements in the plaintext are rearranged. The fundamental requirement is that no \\ninformation be lost (that is, that all operations are reversible). Most systems, referred to as \\nproduct systems, involve multiple stages of substitutions and transpositions. \\n \\nThe number of keys used. If both sender and receiver use the same key, the system is referred \\nto as symmetric, single-key, secret-key, or conventional encryption. If the sender and receiver \\nuse different keys, the system is referred to as asymmetric, two-key, or public-key encryption. \\n \\nThe way in which the plaintext is processed. A block cipher processes the input one block of \\nelements at a time, producing an output block for each input block. A stream cipher processes the \\ninput elements continuously, producing output one element at a time, as it goes along. \\ncsitnepal\\nDownloaded from CSIT Tutor'),\n",

One can attack the cipher text \\nusing exhaustive search by trying all possible keys until you find the right one. Exhaustive search \\nis best suited if the key space is small and we have only 26 possible keys in Caesar cipher. \\nAnother approach of attacking the cipher is statistical analysis where we compare the ciphertext \\nto 1-gram model of English. \\n \\nCaesar’s Problem \\n \\nThe main problem with Caesar’s Cipher is that the key is too short and can be found by \\nexhaustive search. Again statistical frequencies not concealed well i.e. they look too much like \\nregular English letters. So the solution can be to increase the key length (can be done using \\nmultiple letters in key) so that cryptanalysis gets harder. \\n \\nTransposition Cipher \\n \\nIn transposition ciphers the letters are systematically arranged so that the actual position of letters \\nis gets changed making the text garble.   \\n \\n2. Rail-Fence Cipher \\n \\nThe Rail Fence Cipher is a form of transposition cipher that derives its name from the way in \\nwhich it is encoded. In the rail fence cipher, the plaintext is written downwards and diagonally \\non successive \"rails\" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when we reach the bottom rail. \\nWhen we reach the top rail, the message is written downwards again until the whole plaintext is \\nwritten out. The message is then read off in rows.  \\nFor example, using 3 \"rails\" and a message of \\'WE ARE DISCOVERED FLEE AT ONCE\\', the \\ncipherer writes out: \\nW . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E \\n. E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C . \\n. . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . . \\ncsitnepal\\nDownloaded from CSIT Tutor')]"
